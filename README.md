# nlp_dialogflow
Dialog Flow assignment

This is an assignment on using dialogflow for Module 3: Advanced NLP & Temporal Sequence Processing on 22-23 July. The core of the fulfillment is implemented in python flask and hosted on Google Cloud Run. I have supplied my Map API key has to be supplied in the config/apikey.txt for this to run correctly.

In this project, I have demostrated a few features:
* rich UI - images and suggest
* Suggestions
* Parameters flow from 1 session to next e.g. Name of the Person.
* Integration to Google Map

Not all the flow is implemented, the catalog flow has not been implmemented due to time contraints. Future additions like integration to database can be integrated.
